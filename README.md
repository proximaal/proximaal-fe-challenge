## Installation

From the project folder you need to open a terminal window and run the following command

```
npm install
```

After the installation is complete, then run this command

```
npm run server
```

This will start the mock api server @ localhost:3000

Run the next command to start the vue application

```
npm run dev
```

After this a browser window will open @ localhost:8000

## Json-Server

This package is used to create the mock api server. 
I connected the server to the school.json file provided and added a new user route to enable the login procedure.
